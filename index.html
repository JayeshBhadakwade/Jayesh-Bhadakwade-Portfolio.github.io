            <p class="mt-5 text-justify"><strong>Overview:</strong> Ecommerce landing pages are centered around a clear objective of getting customers to complete a set goal. For ecommerce, this is primarily making a purchase. The page is personalized to match the buyer's intent and encourages customers with a straightforward call to action (CTA).Landing pages should attract leads and connect the site to marketing actions, such as pay-per-click ads, promotions on social networks, links on emails, etc. Landing pages are also a good resource to attract organic traffic through keyword strategies that enhance search engine positioning.In this design I tried to add attractive and user interactive designs which makes the user to explore more products listed on the website.  <br><br>
          
              <strong>Case Study:</strong>The main aim while designing this UI design was to develop an appealing and functional landing page that would be more user-friendly, and increase user trust. The main challenge was to make a design simple yet interactive that would make the user to engage with the products and their design. Some main factors to be consider when designing an e-commerce landing page.<br>
              <strong>1. Use quality photos and videos - </strong>Having no opportunity to appreciate the products IRL, their photo and video representations are everything a visitor has to rely on. This is a point where the offline-stores have an undeniable advantage. At least, for now. That is why for modern e-commerce website design it’s vital that photos and videos should be of quality. The better this representation is, the more users will like the particular online store. This includes high-res photos, 360-degree views, 3D-models, and videos.<br>
              <strong>2. Add convenient navigation, filtering, and search -</strong> Convenience is the main reason why people shop online. How much will a user buy if they feel uncomfortable? The major UX design trend of today is to create websites that make life easier for consumers and smoothly take them to the most important step — a purchase or other targeted action (leaving contact details, registering, and so on). To achieve this, a designer must think through every little detail.<br>
              <strong>3. Add some beauty and personality- </strong>This point may seem to contradict the previous one, but it doesn’t. 38% of users leave a website if they find the layout unattractive. Attractiveness is a subjective thing, but the main idea is that just because a website is simple doesn’t mean it should be devoid of beauty and personality. One of the things to consider when designing an e-commerce website is to find a balance between aesthetics and usefulness.<br>
              <strong>4. Keep it consistent and branded-</strong> A website design should correspond with the products, reflect them, complement the brand, create a unique feeling for the products. An e-commerce website is a major part of a brand’s identity and it’s a designer’s job to convey the attributes and values they want the products to embody.Users remember the branded design. To stand out from the crowd, a unique identity is a prerequisite. The concept of corporate identity includes a logo, slogan, corporate fonts, and colors. So make sure to use the same fonts, colors and general design patterns throughout the website to make users recognize and remember the brand. Presenting a brand consistently across all platforms can increase revenue by up to 23%.<br>

             <p class="text-justify"> <strong>Most important elements of a successful landing page:</strong> <br>
              1) Have only one and clear conversion goal (e.g. getting a new user)<br>
              2) Make sure every element of your page supports this conversion goal.<br>
              3) There is one CTA (call-to-action) button always visible, so the user can decide any time to use it.<br><br></p>
              
              
              <p class="text-justify">
              Designs is a chance to make a good first impression for an e-commerce website. It has a direct effect on how much time users are going to spend there and how much they are going to buy. It shows like how important all the design aspects are: from the beautiful UI to the elaborate UX. With e-commerce website design, it is very important to design and showcase the products which the user are willing to buy, in our example shoes.So,the main challenge was to design the products such a way that the user explores more about the products like colors, price in the landing page itself So, that the user gets well aware about the variety of the products and their functions.Color selection is a tricky proposition for designers, especially those of us working with physical products where decisions are more permanent.

              Data shows that consumers make up their minds about a product within seven to ninety seconds of their initial interaction. Depending on which source you consult, between forty and ninety percent cite color as the main deciding factor.
              
              It’s generally accepted that when consumers are faced with comparable product function and price, most will base their purchase decision based on the product’s appearance. So the major design feature that this landing page consist is the colour of the entire landing page changes when the colour of the product is switched this gives user a moral connection with the page and product.<br><br>

It is a global company that originated in California USA. The founders of the company are the world-renowned Steve Jobs with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne.

              Apple started with manufacturing and selling personal computers but has now expanded into many sectors.

              <strong>Case Study:</strong> When it comes to apple watches their are many customizations as well as new designs let out by apple for their customers. This design came from the thought that whenever apple launches their new products in our case apple watches their is huge excitement in the customers to see the new designs and specs of the products. Specifically this design is made for the new arrival of apple watches. In this design the main focus was to showcase the new colours and the new designs for the newly launched apple watches. I took the color theme of the apple watch and made the use of this color theme in the interface of this Landing page which gives it a more attractive and realistic feel. The main challenge was the animation through which this design of this User interface felt more lively. Although the shape and functionality of each Apple Watch will be largely the same, Apple is introducing a choice of sizes, colors and even metal composition, along with a selection of accompaning watchbands -- some utilitarian and some quite posh. The animations and transitions in this design was the main takeaway of this design, the transition of the watch from one design to another along with the change in the background colours of the landing page in corelation gives the user a interactive as well as soothing feel while exploring the products. <br></p>
    
              <p class="text-justify">
                One of the major factors that influence consumer buyer behaviour is psychological factors. Psychological factors can be distribute into five categories, that is motivation, perception, learning ,beliefs and attitudes and this all can influence a person’s buying choices. Our brain has huge impact of what our eyes see, same concept is used in this landing page that is to create excitement about the newly launched products in thier whole new design. This type of landing page can directly connect with the Customers because the new designs are showcased in the landing page itself. <br><br>

              <strong>Case Study:</strong> The Home Decor/Furniture design should be such that the customers visiting the website should corelate their home interior design with the designs displayed in the website. So, that their product selection process gets easy and there are more chances the customer would select the product just based on the design of the furniture displayed on the landing page.The Home Decor/Furniture design should not be only about aesthetics and appearance but more about the functionality, desirability, and overall experience of using the product. The design on Landing page should be minimalistic and clean which enhances the user experience adding more functionality to the web design. While designing this landing page the main aim was to use the appropriate images along with using interactive animation features.<br></p>
    
    
             <p class="text-justify"> <strong> For the design of the landing page points to be considered:</strong> <br> 
              1) Limit the calls to action in your design and make it clear and simple to undertake.<br>
              2) Make the form appear as professional and credible as possible by including awards and testimonials from customers.<br>
              3) Present your best products at landing page will really atrract visitors.<br>
              4)Use simple images that tell people what lies behind the landing page.<br><br>
              Use simple words which are clear and easy to understand. Do not clutter your page with unnecessary words to eliminate distraction, confusion or overwhelming your visitors.

              I made this landing page using minimalistic design, I made the logo which decribes the brand quite effectively the main purpose was to keep the logo design quite simple but attractive. The nav section consist of products, Home decor tabs. The images used in this landing page was taken from shutterstock and unsplash site. To choose the right images was quite a challenging task. The main feature of this landing page is the animations of the products which allow the customer to explore the variety of the products along with the suitable background for which the product will suite. This feature helps the customer to make right decision while purchasing the product.The customer will not have to worry that if the product will suite their home interior or not.<br>
              The right section of the landing page is the main highlight. The circular portion at the right side of the page is designed for the customer to explore through the designs of the main products available. This section is fully animated in such a way that when a cursor is placed over the design it give it a hover effect which makes the design quite attractive. The arrows are also provided at the bottom left of the section which can also be used to switch the products on the landing page. The tag line used 'Being at home Meet your new comfort zone' describes that the customer can choose their furniture design sitting at home without visiting any offline store just by exploring through this landing page the customer will be have the confidence to choose the right type of chair or any furniture based on thier needs or thier Home interior requirements. The concept of the displaying the products along with a suitable background makes the customer feel confident while choosing a product which will suit the interior of thier home.

            <p class="mt-5 text-justify"><strong>Overview:</strong> Netflix, in full Netflix, Inc., media-streaming and video-rental company founded in 1997 by American entrepreneurs Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. It is also involved in the creation of original programming. Corporate headquarters are in Los Gatos, California.

              In 1999 Netflix began offering an online subscription service through the Internet. Subscribers chose movie and television titles from Netflix’s Web site; the shows were then mailed to customers in the form of DVDs, along with prepaid return envelopes, from one of more than 100 distribution centres.Although customers typically rented for a flat monthly fee as many movies per month as they wished, the number of DVDs in their possession at any one time was limited according to their subscription plans. Netflix had tens of thousands of movie titles in its catalog.  <br><br>
          
              <strong>Case Study:</strong> Since the UI of Netflix webpages, Apps and landing pages are quite impressive I made a decision to design a netflix web page to challenge my design skills. This project may be called a Netflix clone UI Webpage but I have made some Design tweeks in this web design. The main challenge faced was the masking effect of the money Hiest series which I used in the TV section which looks quite attractive. Different TV shows can be displayed in the this section to inform the users about the latest/Upcoming TV series available on Netflix.    <br></p>
              <p class="text-justify">
                I have also made a Sign In page of Netflix this page is accessed by Sign In button at the top of the Web home page. The animate function is used give a transition while switching from Home page to the Sign In page. The Black colour gradient is used while designing the Web home page as well as the Sign In page which ressembles to design element of the Netflix Web page. The font used in design of the web interface is Poppins which gives it a similarity with the Original website. Designing such a web page using these design elements was quite a challenging task. <br><br> Major things to learn from the Netflix UI design that from  their website to how the app is designed for mobile and TV, all platforms are a seamless experience. With a product like Netflix, you have to consider the intent of the user. When someone logs onto Netflix, they’re in the mood to watch something right now. They might already know what they want to watch but more than likely, they’ll need to browse for a bit. Netflix does many things right to help the user on this journey.First, the top half of the screen begins to auto-play after a few seconds, this helps the user get a sense of the movie or show from a quick “mini-trailer” clip. If someone is interested and wants to learn, they have the option to press play or more info.
                As you scroll through more selections of what to watch, you get the same auto-play feature when you hover over one thumbnail for more than a few seconds. While this feature helps solve the problem for the user of finding something that interests them to watch, it can get annoying after a while. Netflix also thought of this and gave the user the option to disable the sound and previews why browsing.  <br><br>

            <p class="mt-5 text-justify"><strong>Challenge:</strong> To create a user friendly Ecommerce fashion mobile app for a brand or a company which allows thier customers to explore thier fashion products and fulfill thier fashion needs with a hassle free User Experience. A simplistic clothing marketplace that caters to the needs of regular shoppers.<br><br>
            
              <strong>Approach:</strong> To design a fashion app for the retail business owners or a company which allows them the opportunity to display thier fashionable items to all the people worldwide. As thier store is online anyone can purchase thier product; it does not matter whether they live in small town. Today’s era is the age of competition. Thus apps are mandatory for Designers and Store Owners and if they want to succeed they have to keep pace with the technological advancement. So, as a designer or a store owner, it is must to have a mobile app even if you are conducting bussiness on a small scale. <br><br>
              <strong>Goals:</strong> 1) My goal was to build a UI design that customers find easy to use. Sticking to the template of e-commerce that people are comfortable with and improvising it to make it more user friendly.<br><br>
             2) A clear description of size, brand and details such as fabric, design, etc. present right on the product screen will make them easily readable and act as a quality check for sellers.<br><br>
             3) The goal of the product is to deliver a quality experience with a simple and attractive interface. The best choice is to build a mobile application to increase reach and impact. A well-designed e-commerce app can be more effective than a website as it is quicker and easy to use.<br><br>
             4) Identify and design the desired branding for the new product to enhance the user experience<br><br>
  
             <strong>Design Brief:</strong> 
                 The main thought was to create an e-commerce marketplace where people can shop for their favourite clothing item. A simple and attractive one-stop destination to shop for clothes. E-commerce sales have increased by 28% following the Covid pandemic with clothing being the third-largest item.This app, designed for the people who do not want to waste time browsing through clothes instead simplified access to trendy clothes.The app is a simplistic way to shop for clothing items without spending much time and effort in the process. The idea to make it suitable for the little attention span that the younger audience has, drives the elegant and manageable design of the app.<br><br>
                 Such apps can be used by smaller retailers who cannot compete with the low prices offered by larger e-commerce websites. They can use apps similar to this to build their remote marketplace for local customers and build an online community of buyers. The Main problem is that the Most of the big-name e-commerce websites are home to a wide range of products, including clothing. With very cheap pricing, the quality of clothes deteriorates, and products may not be the same as displayed. It provides a need to create smaller platforms where quality and pricing are balanced, and consumers can enjoy shopping for clothes.<br><br>
  
            In the design of this app I was mainly focused on the design theme to give it a quirky feel, the launch screen of the app is designed by using a attractive background image followed by the Logo which quite effectively describes the brand name with a elegant color theme. The Launch screen also consist of the two sign in options by which the the user can sign in with their email or a facebook account. A tagline is used to represent the focus of the brand message. </p>

        <p class="mt-5 text-justify"><strong> Case Study :</strong> Smartwatches are not a new concept. The idea goes back at least to the 1940s with the introduction of Dick Tracy's communicator watch. It's taken them a while to come to fruition, but watches that have computing functionalities and work hand-in-hand with smartphones are finally part of the electronics market. They can notify you when you have calls, display your messages and upcoming meetings, and act as controllers for your phone's music and other apps. And now Apple is entering the fray.

          At Apple's Sept. 2014 special event keynote, CEO Tim Cook introduced the Apple Watch, alongside the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. He referred to the Watch as "the most personal device we've ever created" [source: Apple]. Its name was missing the ubiquitous "i" that prefixes many Apple products, but its sleek design and user-friendly interface seemed very much in line with those of the company's other popular consumer products.<br>
          Aside from the expected functions such as answering calls, messaging, keeping appointments, finding directions and playing music (things for which many have come to rely on their phones), it adds facilitating payments, monitoring your heart rate and, in some cases, even unlocking doors. It also apparently keeps incredibly accurate time, and doubles as a fashion accessory with lots of customizability. <br><br>


        
         <strong>Design Brief:</strong> 
         Although the shape and functionality of each Apple Watch will be largely the same, Apple watches comes with a choice of sizes, colors and even metal composition, along with a selection of accompanying watchbands -- some utilitarian and some quite posh. Apple allows thier users to choose from a selection of specially designed straps, depending upon which model you get, including the following:<br>Sport Band - A custom sweat and chemical resistant fluoroelastomer band available in black, white, blue, green and pink. All five appear to be available with Watch Sport, but only black or white with the other two models.<br>Classic Buckle - A leather band with a traditional watch buckle in black with Watch, or in midnight blue with one of the Watch Edition models.<br>Leather Loop - A quilted leather band that fastens with magnets, in stone, light brown or bright blue for Watch.<br>Modern Buckle - A leather band with a solid metal buckle, in soft pink, brown and midnight blue for Watch, with additional bright red and rose gray bands available with Watch Edition models.<br>Milanese Loop - A flexible, magnetic stainless steel mesh for Watch.<br>Link Bracelet - A traditional looking, brushed metal link watch band, in stainless steel or space black stainless steel for Watch.<br><br>The Customizability of the apple watches is something which struck my mind from the thought that the straps of the apple watches can be customized according to the liking of the user. From this feature, A idea struck my mind that why not create a UI design wherein the apple watch users can customize their apple watches from a UI app design.
         I mainly choose the five types of the straps design to customize on a single dial due to design limitations. This UI app design also allows the user to customize the dial as well as straps of the watches to match the elements according to their liking. <br><br>

        <p class="text-justify"> The UI of the app design is quite minimalistic wherein the top of the app consist of the Apple logo. Fonts used in this design in Poppins which quite resembles and matches to the original apple UI. The middle part of the UI consist of the dial to which the customization is to be applied, the straps can be applied to the dial by tapping the small icons at the bottom of the app. The main challenge was to animate the movement of the straps when it attaches on to the dial body. The lower part of the app is the main section which consist of the icons through which the dials, straps and any other product can be customized. The icons at bottom most portion of the app is designed with very high details wherein the texture of the strap can be seen in those icons. These details while designing this ui was quite of a challenging task. These icons allows the user to interchange the strap design according to the liking of the user. The main challenge was to animate the movement of the straps when they attaches the dial body. Snap auto animate feature is used to give this animation a realistic feel.   </p>

          <p class="mt-5 text-justify"><strong>Case Study:</strong> Netflix was a breakthrough app in online streaming when it was launched. It is an American media service provider that caused many households to cut cords with their cable connection. With a wide array of television shows, documentaries and movies available, this streaming giant now operates in over more than 190 countries.While it originally started as a DVD service, Netflix launched online streaming in 2007. This boosted its popularity, giving birth to many similar competitive services like Hulu, Amazon Prime , Youtube TV etc. A significant name in online entertainment, Netflix is arguably the premium streaming video service provider as of now. It has consistently seen an exponential growth with a whopping 158 million paying subscribers worldwide!<br><br>
            The Netflix UI App design is quite impressive because of the themes, types, graphics, images and content that you see are a part of Netflix UI. These are the tangible elements that attract the user towards the brand’s page. This happens to be the designing part of Netflix UI UX. One of the most remarkable features of Netflix UI is that it has two separate themes for adults and children’s account. User Experience or UX of Netflix in contrast is how efficiently it interacts and fulfills your demands. This process involves user research, creating prototypes and wireframes, formation of information architecture, creating better accessibility and computer-human interaction facilities and much more. We can simply state that it is the experience that a user runs into after using a product or service. <br><br>
            Netflix is a great example of UX done right. From their website to how the app is designed for mobile and TV, all platforms are a seamless experience. With a product like Netflix, you have to consider the intent of the user. When someone logs onto Netflix, they’re in the mood to watch something right now. They might already know what they want to watch but more than likely, they’ll need to browse for a bit. Netflix does many things right to help the user on this journey.<br><br>
            As the Netflix UI App design is quite impressive because of the themes, types, graphics, images, I tried to design the Netflix UI App design. This was quite of a challenging task to design the Netflix UI. I tried to design Splash Screens, Onboarding screens, Login, Sign Up and Home screens of the Netflix UI. The main challenge was to design the Home Page of the netflix app which consist of different and unique design features.<br><br>
            The main challenge I faced was the animation of the netflix app during the launch of the splash screeen, this feature was designed using masking features along with that the prototyping of this app was also quite of a challenging task.<br><br>
            So i tried to design UI for the Netflix app with good interface, good quality images and easy usability. This app was designed for a iOS interface wherein the UI kits provided at the apple website were used which made the design very realistic. Then mockups of these screens were created using Photoshop tool. This UI design feels very attractive and there were many things to learn while designing this netflix UI design.  <br>

          <p class="mt-5 text-justify"><strong>Case Study:</strong> The hotel booking application needs a smooth user experience. In order to create a successful app, we first need to implement a full process of understanding what the user’s pain points are and address them through intentional design.Interaction designs need to be simple, yet effective and rid of any clunky user experiences. Information should be organized logically and intuitively. Smart layout design paired with convenient features can go a long way and prevent the user from feeling overwhelmed.<br><br>
            I feel like the Hotel Booking App should be convenient, especially when users going through the checkout process. because time is precious and the user is most likely not going to enjoy scrolling for important information. And also we have to keep it simple and logical, User can quickly feel overwhelmed by interfaces or wordy descriptions. rely on basic design principles to create clean and smart layouts in a way that can make users feel easy to understand the app.<br><br>
            Restaurants are highly local businesses and in order to increase their customer base, there are very limited options and avenues. Client wanted to explore digital options for growing the customer base.<br><br>
            This Hotel app is designed for the users to book the hotel room for a stay in a hotel using attractive user Interfaces and design features. The Ui of this app is designed using a unique colour combination and features which improves the user expireince as well as give it a unique look. The app consist of Sign Up, Login page and a home page. The app is made with a color combination of a orange and a white which gives it a very attractive design feature.<br><br>
            The main features in the home page consist of search bar wherein the user can search the hotels available at their disired location at which the user wants to stay. All the listed hotels available at that location are displayed in the home page wherein the user have to select the disired hotel based on various factors like thier accomodation, No. of beds, Parking facility, price etc. The user will get all the information related to the hotel on a single click. The Facilities provided by the hotels and related information are displayed at the home screen giving user a full idea about the hotel. The user can also save a hotel which they have stayed in for further accomodation when required. The user can find various hotels based on thier location of accomodation. While selecting a particular hotel the users can select a hotel based on the ratings of the hotel provided in the app interface. This app also provides the information like whether the hotel is pet friendly, Furnished etc. This app is designed using the snap auto animate feature which gives this app a different user expirience. Also one of the important feature is that when a user clicks on a particular hotel page the description and information of the hotel is displayed which gives user a overview of the hotel.       <br>
